## Perfect Number

  A positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors except the number itself.

    divisors - 1,2,3
      1 + 2 + 3 = 6, So 6 is a perfect number
      
## Abundant Number

  A positive number that is less than the sum of all positive integers that are submultiples of it.
  example -> 12
    submultiple - 1,2,3,4,6

      16 > 12, So 12 is an abundant number
